If not, thanks for trying this out.\n\nThis game contains options to choose the genders of the two main romantic options(RO's for short). You can either choose this as you encounter the character in question, preset both of them to a set gender, or randomize their genders.\n\nThere are also various [b]achievements[/b], which can either be presented as they are earned or hidden until the epilogue of the game (unless you play on Steam, which does as it pleases).\n\n",

The quakes had ripped the entire West Coast infrastructure to shreds, destroying most of the historic districts. The San Andreas Fault had just finished rippling when the Cascadia subduction zone was triggered, and the entire coastline heaved like a shaken rug, sending tsunamis racing up and down the coast.\n\nThe seismic upheaval awoke the slumbering Mammoth Lake system, one of the continent’s two dormant supervolcanos. Luckily—if such a word could be used for a disaster of that magnitude—the lava chamber under the dormant volcano had not filled completely, and the eruption was less disastrous than it could have been. \n\nWhat the quakes had not destroyed, the resulting tsunami drowned. And when the ash had finally stopped falling, someone had looked at the ruins of Los Angeles and decided that this was no longer a place fit for angels. \n\nThus, Los Diablos was born. \n\nAt first, the government had tried to rebuild the ravaged coastline, but aftershocks and a crashing economy forced the politicians to focus on salvaging the Heartland and the East. The Midwest had been heavily affected by the falling ash, and the resulting food rationing made riots an everyday experience.\n\nAs the years passed, reclamation stalled. In 1992, the West Coast was finally declared a free economic zone in an attempt to incite the private industry to do what the government could not. \n\nNo taxes. No regulations. No federal government.\n\nTo everybody's surprise, it worked. Like the Wild West of old, the ravaged coastline attracted the adventurous and the foolhardy. Enough people wanted to live their lives without being held down by the heavy hand of big government so that the wave of refugees turned into a trickle of immigrants. Enough companies wanted to ply their trade without rules and regulations for money to flow in as well. The roads began to be repaired, and the cities, cleared of rubble. \n\nAnd, right from the start, Los Diablos proved to be a haven for the Enhanced.\n\n",

Corners had been cut and safety trials skipped, so the pill hit the market as a dietary supplement instead of a strictly controlled drug. \n\nNone was shocked that there were side effects, but the nature of those effects was a different story. \n\nMany people died, but in some, the metabolic changes resulted in weird and wondrous transformations. The rumors became reality when a woman who could light fires with her mind demonstrated her talents on live television. The active compound was analyzed, purified, and modified until you had a drug strong enough to kill most people. \n\nBut the few survivors became far more than they had been.\n\nThe drug was banned, of course, declared an illegal narcotic in 1976. How many people could consider injecting something that had a roughly 95% chance of killing you or turning you into a cripple for life?\n\nThe answer was, surprisingly many. \n\nThey were the dreamers and the desperate, the thrill-seekers, the greedy, and the plain insane. Prices went through the roof.\n\nThe industry went underground, and when it resurfaced, it was in the reclaimed ruins of the West. The world had to relearn what it meant to be human; it had to adjust to masked heroes and villains battling it out in colorful costumes, with bombastic names. At first, the masks had been a way to preserve anonymity; the bank-robber's mask turned into the villain's horned helmet. Soon, the masks had begun to represent something else. A new life. A new destiny. \n\nIt was a new America, and it deserved new heroes. \n",

Putting the cat back in the box is harder than letting it out, and in the end, they just had to accept this new state of affairs. The drugs were undeniably lethal, but the military had been making enhanced humans since Vietnam. And as the research companies moved west in the nineties, the lack of regulations led to new discoveries. Progress that, admittedly, was built on human suffering—but nobody could make an omelet without cracking a few eggs. \n\nCybernetics had been used by the military since the fifties, but now they became compact and better-integrated with biology; armored suits grew sleeker and less prone to breakdowns. Washington made the decision that though the West was nominally considered a Free Territory, the government had to have some presence there to deal with the increasingly violent Enhanced.\n\nThus, in 1997, the Marshal system was instituted. Appointed by the president himself, the marshals were given the powers of judge and jury and sent into the West to create some semblance of order. Some were victims of the Hero drug, quickly nicknamed Boosts by the general populace. Others were rebuilt by the government or private contractors into cybernetic \"enhanciles\" armed with military hardware. They were heavily modified humans, their name soon shortened to Mods in the headlines of the East. \n\nNow the public had heroes as well as villains, and the country turned from grieving its dead to looking towards a future dragged from the comic books of the past.\n\nAmerica was hiding under the blanket, reading comics with a flashlight, trying to forget the terrors of the world outside. And it worked. Nothing is more precious than a dream, and this was one that could resonate with enough people so that the trickle of immigrants moving west turned into a flood. \n\nNew cities grew on the corpses of the old ones, and though the quakes persisted, people learned to live with them. They learned to live with the danger because there was always the thrill as well. The thrill of living in a brand-new age where men and women flew like birds and called down rain from the clouds to end the incessant droughts. \n\nPeople had a dream, and like a fool, you shared that dream.

It's not every day that you get a sight like that, even in Los Diablos. How many phones are out, taking furtive shots of the proceedings?\n\nWith the Public Privacy law making it illegal to film or take pictures of people without their consent (or a license), none of these shots will make it into the newspapers. But if you know where to look, you bet it will be all over the net come evening.\n\nThere was a lot of debate when the law was pushed through, but as the country was under martial law, there was no real opposition. Funnily enough, it only tends to be enforced when the people targeted are public or company officials; there are far too many things that need to be kept out of the public eye.\n\nYou know all about that.\n\n\"No, I don't care what Mayor Alvarez has to say. You don't have the jurisdiction here.\" Marshal Steel speaks the way he stands, as if he was two seconds from punching you in the face. When you first met, you had the illusion that there had to be some sort of warm and mushy center under the tough exterior. But after a few years, you grew out of that delusion. Maybe he was in the military for too long.\n\nOr maybe he disliked you too much….\n\n\"She rampaged through the Citadel Mall.\" The LDPD sergeant stands his ground, which is impressive. \"…And that is after the mess she caused on the way there.\"\n\nLooks like relations between the two groups have not gotten better in your absence. Good. That will make things a lot easier for you.\n\n\"It is still not your jurisdiction.\" Steel is turning around, clearly done with the discussion.\n\n\"Listen.\" The LDPD sergeant actually places a hand on Steel's arm, and the crowd gasps, hoping for blood. \"If you can't even control your own people, we—\"\n\nSteel has turned back now, very gently removing the hand from his armor. Despite the LDPD body armor, you know that Steel's powered combat suit could easily crush both the man's head and hand if he wanted to. \"We are the ones who will deal with this,\" Steel cuts him off. \"Whatever caused Lady Argent to run amok, it is our business. Not yours.\"\n\n\"The mayor will be in touch about this, Marshal.\" The sergeant rubs his hand. Though you can't see his face behind the faceplate of his helmet, you can see in the way he tenses up that this is not over.\n\nShould you stir the waters a little?\n\n",

That's his name, but it's not important. Reaching out, you pull on the feelings of entitled frustration you can sense. He just wants respect, and Steel refuses to give it to him. That's something you can feed, turning a passing annoyance into a long-running resentment. This will be one less ally for the Rangers, and who knows when that will come in handy.\n\nYou are playing the long game here, after all.\n",

For a moment, everything freezes.

If that were the case, there would be no way ${he} would be this flustered over the most innocent of comments.\n\n[i]Not that you are an innocent. Far from it, in fact.\n",

Naivety or not, Ortega really did save you back then. You can still smell the acrid smoke coming from the fried armor and see Ortega's worried face as ${he} freed you from the rubble.\n\nBut that was years ago. You're no longer Sidestep, and Ortega is a distant memory. Playing the hero is a thing of the past. Most dreams pop like bubbles when they are confronted with reality.\n\nYou know yours did.\n\nAnd that is why you avoid sleep when you can. The nightmares are always there to remind you.\n\nYou free yourself from the sheets, but make no effort to get up. You know your legs would be shaking, and that would be an intolerable weakness. Better to just sit here and stare into the dark, and pretend that everything is alright. Pretend that the best times in your life aren't fodder for your nightmares. Pretend that you're still in control.\n\nNo. That is not pretending. You are in control. And sometimes, that means turning into a nightmare yourself.\n\nIf that is the only way to beat them.\n\nTaking a deep breath, you finally stand, pleased to see that your legs and hands are steady once more. That is how it should be: Sidestep is dead, and ${name} is just a face you wore in the past. Not who you will be in the future.\n\nHeading to the shower, you strike up a jaunty whistle, focusing on the positive. Waking up before your alarm just means you have more time to prepare for your meeting later tonight. In Los Diablos, the underworld comes to life when the normal world goes to sleep. It's a daunting prospect to function in both those worlds, but you have an ace up your sleeve.\n\nYou don't bother to turn on the light in the bathroom, as showering in the dark is a remarkably peaceful experience. You need a bit of peace of mind right now.\n\nIt was a risk getting this close to the Rangers this early. But they had what you needed, so there really was no choice. Lady Argent ending up in battle was not what you had planned, but at least you managed to complete your mission. That's all that counts, right? You know that is true. But still…\n\n",

You know exactly how ${he} works, and sadly that means that ${he} knows the same of you….\n\nThat will be a hard lesson to unlearn. Part of you still thinks of ${him} as an ally; you just have to work on remembering exactly why that is not the case anymore.\n\nHowever, tonight you will leave all thoughts of what has been behind you. It's time to get dressed up and get to work.\n\nThe kind of work that you can't do looking like yourself….\n\nIt's not that you are bad looking, at least not with your clothes on. They made sure of that. Of course, you can't allow yourself to look too attractive either and draw another kind of attention you are not ready for.\n\nOn the streets, you are essentially a nobody: just another tired soul, shoulders slumped in your habitual ignore-me pose. With your past being what it is, though, you are still far too recognizable by people you want to steer clear of, especially in the Enhanced circles. If you want to have any hope of pulling this off, you need to be discreet.\n\nAnd that means not being yourself.\n\nIf there is one thing you have learned about people, it is that there are two ways to avoid attention. The first is by doing what you do in your real body; be quiet and unremarkable so nobody will notice you. The second is to stand out, be bold, and lean into people's preconceptions. A beautiful woman with a body to die for and a face that will mix with the memories of all other beautiful women out there. A handsome man with the whitest of smiles and as forgettable as the fading warmth of his handshake. \n\nMasks. Puppets.\n",

You have an agreement of sorts: you use ${phis} empty body, and in return ${phe} doesn't waste away in a hospital bed. Not that ${phe} has signed any papers. It's been years, and you've yet to find any trace of thoughts or a personality in there. \n\n$!{phis} mind is gone for good, so you doubt ${phe}'d mind if you helped yourself to ${phis} leftovers. \n\nTo keep your two identities separate, you got ${phim} an apartment of ${phis} own. Though it is a bit of a risk, it sits right on top of your own because to truly slip into someone's mind (or lack of it) and possess them, you need to be close. \n\nClose enough to single out their thoughts from the hive that is humanity.\n\nThat used to be the case. While it still is true for your other victims, slipping into ${puppet_name} is as comfortable as slipping into an old pair of jeans. With the amount of practice you have had, you've managed to possess ${phim} from miles away—though that leaves your original body defenseless if you leave it resting somewhere else.\n\nThere was not much of a selection of comatose bodies, so you picked ${phim} mostly for convenience. That ${phe} looks good is an added bonus, and was what made you decide to lean into it to make ${phim} a better mask.\n\n",

There are bars like it all over the coast. Some are pretentious and call themselves things like Darkside, or the Black Hole.

It's not a friendly place, and few but the regulars stay there for long. \n\nJoe, which really is the name of the owner, tends to hire the scariest down-and-outs he can find to keep strangers from lingering, and it works. There are far better places for a drink within walking distance. Unless you're bad. Unless you're Enhanced. Unless you've got the right contacts. Because then, the door at the back will open and reveal the real Joes, securely concealed beneath a layer of scramblers thick enough to fool any uninvited guests.\n\nThe security measures are another reason you take ${puppet_name} to Joes. Scramblers like that always leave you with a headache that will plague you for days—not to mention the fact that Joes has telepathic dampeners and those remove your best weapon.

To using them….\n\nThem…\n\nIn a world filled with Enhanced people, some things are still more taboo than others. Be they Boosts or Mods, all the Enhanced are human at the core, no matter how wildly they have deviated from their origins. Not so the Re-Genes. \n\nLike robotic constructs, Re-Genes are created, not born. They are subject to none of the rights of a proper human being. Like stem cell clones, they are supposedly mindless, just a body to strip for parts with no soul to fill it.\n\nHuman ingenuity might have enabled the GeniTech Corporation to reconstruct humanoid beings from the ground up. But giving them a mind, much less a soul? That is impossible. \n\nCircumventing this limitation, the Re-Genes that the Special Directive employ as weapons are outfitted with artificial minds: advanced AIs that can mimic the acts of people, but aren't truly alive.\n\nOr so the story goes.\n\nThe Re-Genes are put in distinctive uniforms, their faces and bodies covered with bright tattoos, marking them for the tools they are. These warning signs are there to make people keep their distance, as the powers involved are often much more dangerous than what normal Boosts could wield and survive. They also make it impossible to confuse Re-Genes with a normal human, especially when combined with their distinctive blue-gray skin. \n\nAlways a controversial presence, most of the Re-Genes are used in the wars abroad. But several teams always remain on US soil, ready to be put to use should the Special Directive require it. \n\nLike now. \n\nBecause you called them in….\n\nYour hands are still shaking. Shivering a little, you put them in your armpits to try to warm them up as you wait. You wish you could just let your mind go blank and settle into your usual, patient routine. Not this time though; right now your mind just keeps churning, a hornet's nest of anxiety.\n\n",

The evacuation of the surrounding block is continuing, and…\" Ortega keeps talking, but you have stopped listening.\n\n[i]Your head is throbbing with a low-level toothache. Ortega is right about this thing being telepathic in nature; you can feel the pressure against your shields. Even though you complain about Steel being around, that annoyance is at least a known thing. Telepathic dampeners might hurt…but what is in there hurts worse.\n\n[i]You're not the only one feeling it either. There's an officer over at the cordon who keeps looking towards the building.

The explosions cascade black shadows over the ground, the maze of boxes giving you more than enough cover as you run. You can feel panicked little screams light up and disappear. ${hench_name} is still conscious, but there's someone else back there, clearing out possible reinforcements.\n\nOne of the Special Directive.\n\nYou're not sure what class; it's hard to make out details through the shielded minds back there. But since they are not going for Psychopathor and you haven't seen any flashy display of powers, it is probably one of the standard SCOs. That means strength and speed in various combinations, and probably armor as well. Perhaps some sort of natural projectile attack, or a quiet needle gun. An expert killer.\n\nThat thought hits you right in the gut, and you dodge behind a crate as machine guns open fire with a cacophony of noise. Apparently the WolfPack has noticed what is going on and is trying to take down whatever it is that's attacking them. They won't stand a chance….\n\n",

But to use them on so many targets at once, reading and sending at the same time…\n\nCan you really do this?\n\nFive spots the target first, surprising them with a burst of fire that makes them roll back to gain some distance as Six lays down covering fire. Who's close…Four? Yes, Four will do.\n\nYou spur them on, making them rush forward, heedless of danger, fearing that the target will slip away if you wait. But your push is too brutal. In their instinctive wince, they miss the fact that the target has shifted, turning escape into attack. There's a sharp stab of fear and pain as Four gets eviscerated, and you jerk back, pushing hard to get One into the right position to get off a shot.\n\nThe shot misses—it's harder than you thought to just nudge their natural instincts. Your orders are delivered with a fist and not a pointed finger.\n\n$!{swear}! You're not sure you can do this.\n\nNo. You grit your teeth, focusing on the task at hand. You can do this. Just use them to tire the target out, to give you an advantage. Wait for an opening….\n\nYou push Three and Seven into advancing together, hoping they will be able to cover each other's backs. Where is the target, where…\n\nThree screams loudly as he's hamstrung. Seven fires blindly, but the target is gone again, back into the shadows. You push Five and Six to fire towards where the operative disappeared, trying to block out Three's screams of pain. \n\nIt doesn't work very well.\n\nOne screams next—you had forgotten about them in the fray. They're down, unconscious or dead, and you have to clamp down the fear response hard on the remaining WolfPack. You can't afford to let them run.\n\nInstead, Six catches a glance of the target. You turn them all at once to fire as the operative rolls behind a crate.\n\nThere's no free avenue of escape. You slowly circle around with Seven, making sure they are all keeping their distance.\n\nYou can't let up. Five and Six keep firing. A peek through Six's eyes shows that yes, the target is stationary now, maybe injured….\n",

Your head is swimming; you've lost a lot of blood, and you need to fix yourself up fast.\n\nThe plastic tarp is where you left it, and you have to bite back a whimper of pain as you spread it on the floor. Moving is a bad idea, but you need to get out of these clothes, and it's easier if you do it yourself.\n\nOr maybe easier is the wrong word….\n\nYou nearly faint as you strip, dropping the soaked skinsuit next to you on the tarp. You're cold enough to start shivering, but whether that's due to adrenaline withdrawal, loss of blood, or your naked skin, you are not sure. The kiss of cold plastic against your chest leaves you with a familiar shiver of disgust, and you have to fight to close your eyes. You hate this, you hate feeling this defenseless, but it needs to get done fast.\n\nYou can feel the trickle of blood down your body as you abandon it for ${puppet_name}'s calm and pain-free body.\n\nA moment of darkness…\n\nA breath taken…\n\nYou jolt awake with a startled gasp as ${puppet_name}'s body tries to compensate for the damage your mind insists must be there. It takes a moment for your heart to slow down, and you get to your feet as quickly as you are able. Anticipating that something like this might happen, you left ${puppet_name} with ${phis} clothes on, ready in case your body needed help.\n\nYou must hurry.\n\nIt's times like this you are glad that it's just a flight of stairs between your two apartments. You hurry downstairs as fast as you can, keeping an eye out for any other residents. Not that they would care—that's one of the reasons you picked this particular place; none of the current inhabitants are the overly curious kind.\n\nStill, you look around quickly as you unlock the door, getting inside as fast as you can.\n\n$!{swear}. You can smell the blood from here.\n\nYou quickly pick up the medical kit, walking over to your empty body. It looks like a crime scene, the victim sprawled bonelessly against the backdrop of the black tarp. The gashes left by the Re-Gene's claws still yawn open, trickles of blood seeping out with every breath.\n",

So, you set another meeting point in a dilapidated alley near the old industrial district.\n\nThe doctor sounded far too eager to begin working on it when you called ${mhim} earlier. Besides, the little cluster of telepathic rat brains is getting restless without its 'body,' and you are sure that this had something to do with your recent nightmares. \n\nYou know that dreams can't hurt you, but there are things you would rather remained forgotten.\n\nYou shake your head, pushing down the memories, as you approach the designated meeting point. Perhaps it's the surroundings that brought them up again. The alley has an acrid, chemical smell coming from the nearby industries, and the dusty window of the abandoned storefront reflects nothing but shadows.\n\nIt's a desolate place to meet up, but it's one that's easily accessible and still private enough. The stench discourages anybody lingering—most likely the reason the store was abandoned in the first place.\n\nThis is not the place you want to be. Hiding in a puppet body. Meeting in dirty alleys. But you are not ready yet to take your place on the scene. Not yet.\n\nRunning your finger across the window, you look deep into your puppet's eyes. Are they any different now from when ${phe} was walking around, living ${phis} own life? Would anybody who knew ${phim} back then recognize that there is another intelligence lurking inside?\n\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n$!{phe} has nobody left that could care. You are quite alike that way. Maybe…\n\nMaybe you were too deep in your own thoughts. Maybe you were too used to relying on your telepathy. Maybe you just got sloppy.\n\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\nWhat matters is that as you look away from the reflection of your own eyes in the window, you catch sight of Dr. Mortum there behind you. Holding a gun.\n\nIt is aimed at you.\n\nWith your hands in the air, you try to control the emotions threatening to bleed through.\n\n\"Now, ${title}, do you mind explaining how you've managed to procure this lovely little trinket right after Psychopathor so handily got himself taken in by the Special Directive?\"\n\nThe kiss of the gun is cold as it brushes the back of your head.

Just like almost nobody knows about Ortega's epilepsy.\n\nOnce Dr. Mortum is finished, you will have to pick what your new name will be. Hopefully something a bit more imposing.

Hopefully you will come up with one soon.\n\n\"Sidestep might be dead, but you are not.\" Ortega looks as if ${he}'s not sure ${he} should continue, but does so anyway. \"You're still a telepath, right?\" \n\nThe question surprises you, and for a moment you're not sure what you should say. \n\nMaking up a lie that you have lost your powers seems as unlikely and risky as admitting that you still have them. Ortega believes you are a Boost, someone who took the hero drug and lucked out with a spin on the wheel of fate. If you implied that you had lost your powers…that would have consequences for other Boosts as well, and things could snowball. On the other hand, if you admitted to still being a telepath, you could end up as a possible suspect in the future.\n\n",

It was all too easy to ruin any electrical components ${he} touched, so things had to be specially insulated if ${he} wanted them to last. Hence the insulated brick of a phone.\n\n\"Angie?\" Ortega is not talking loudly, but you are far too curious not to try to listen in. \"Are you around this afternoon? Good. And the rest? Good…I was thinking about coming by, and—\" $!{he} gives you a quick look before continuing. \"I've met someone that might be able to give some input. $!{name} ${surname}.\"\n\nYou suppress a shiver.

Yes…I know, that's why I'm calling you.\" \n\n$!{he} sighs a little, waiting for the person on the other side to calm down. \"Yes, of course I can vouch for ${chim}. I wouldn't suggest this otherwise.\" \n\nAnother pause, interrupted by an amused chuckle. \"Yes, that ${name}. Who else would it be? I know. That's a long story, but yes, very much alive. And retired. I just thought…yes, that's exactly why I suggested it. I'll see you in a while then.\"\n\nYou are quiet for a bit, waiting for Ortega to hang up. \n\n\"Are you okay over there?\" Apparently you were quiet for too long—Ortega has leaned forward a little, looking worried.\n\n",

Just to provide some input on something.\" Ortega clearly seems to be confused about why you are hesitating, which makes sense. While you never actually were a Ranger, you worked with them regularly, and you visited their old headquarters more than once.\n\n\"I wore a mask for a reason back then,\" you sigh, running a hand over your face. \"It's different now.

Back when you stole her body, you did it from afar, so you never had to approach this place in person. The risk was just too great, and you wanted to avoid the very thing you are walking right into now. Old and nosy friends.\n\nIt wasn't even hard to arrange an encounter with her, as she frequented a physical therapist's office located close to a suitable hotel. Since she was on a regular enough schedule for you to prepare in advance, all you had to do was to rent a room under an assumed name and keep an eye out for her as she exited her appointment, mind all relaxed and easy to possess. Habits can be as dangerous as they can be helpful.\n\nBut having done all this in her body also means that you are not prepared for how drab and ordinary this place looks, with its smiling receptionist and bored security officer. The walls look like ordinary walls, painted in subtle colors and hung with posters and pictures. You see no trace of electricity humming through hidden circuits, or of the multitude of security systems you know are there.\n\nThe Rangers are not exactly the LDPD, but they are still an official team. That means the whole package with government liaisons, and everything that comes with it. No wonder you didn't sign up, even when you were on the same side.\n\n",

Even without his armor, his body is heavy with the cybernetic implants needed to control it.\n\nHerald looks up from where he stands, and there is a haggard, nervous look to him, as if he had been pacing. He still has bruises on his face. You can sense the tension in the room even without flexing your telepathic muscles.\n\n\"I'm sorry I had Angie call you all in so suddenly,\" Ortega apologizes, and then gestures towards a chair. \"Have a seat, ${name}, and we'll explain everything.\"\n\nYou take the seat, face carefully calm, though you half expect restraints to snap shut around your wrists and gas to start pouring out of the walls. But there is nothing.\n\nHerald sits down, Lady Argent remains standing, and Marshal Steel taps his fingers against the armrest of his chair as he looks between you and Ortega, as if he doesn't know what to feel. And right now, you can't afford to pry.\n\n",

The tension makes your gut twist.\n\n\"As you wish…${name}.\" Herald smiles, that wide and easy grin that has melted the hearts of millions of fans. He's a relatively new addition to the team, a young man betting against the house as he injected himself with the hero drug, walking away with the powers of flight and durability. Few Boosts hit the kind of jackpot he had. If you hadn't seen the serious look on his face when you walked in, you would have had your doubts whether he had landed yet.\n\n\"Let's move on to the business at hand,\" Ortega starts, sitting down as well. \"I know we all have other things to do, especially you, ${name}. I know that I should respect your retirement, but we can't trust anybody else with this.\"\n\n",

But here, it is too much of a risk.\n\nBut can you really afford to leave her like this? Since she obviously remembers some impressions, how long will it be before she starts to figure out the truth, now that she's met you? Or, worse, how long before they find someone else they trust to help unravel the tangle in her mind?\n\nDamned if you do, damned if you don't.

The truth is, you want Ortega there as a witness, and as an anchor. If ${he} is around, you will have an easier time remembering who you used to be. Sidestep. The hero. $!{He} is the mask you need.\n\n\"If you don't mind, Angie, I'd be honored.\" There is something there that you can't pick up on, something between Ortega and Lady Argent that almost makes her say no. Something that causes her to frown. Something interesting.\n\n\"Fine,\" she says, after a few moments of hesitation. \"You win. We'll do it your way.

If anything, there's a look of regret on his face when you turn around to see him.\n\nHuh. That can't be right.\n\n\"I'll walk you out,\" he says, falling into step beside you, unbidden.\n\nIt's a funny feeling being around Steel without his armor. You're so used to him being massive that it somehow feels off when he's just around your height. To be fair, he's far bulkier than you, and probably weighs at least twice as much.\n\nYou don't know if he's had more of his body replaced with cybernetic implants since back when you knew him, but there was always a good amount of metal hidden behind synth skin. Both his lower legs are artificial, that you know and hear; his stride is a lot heavier than yours. The left arm might be new, if you are reading his body language correctly.\n\n\"So,\" he says, clearing his throat since you still haven't replied to him. It's not a conversation you want to have, but you also know better than to fight him on this.\n\n\"So?\" Maybe if you are lucky you can keep this to single syllable words and get out of here before you reveal yourself.\n\n\"So, you survived.\" Steel cuts in front of you, forcing you to stop. Oh well, a confrontation it is then.\n\n\"That's one way of putting it.\" You don't bother to put on the smiling mask for him; this is not Ortega. Steel doesn't care one whit how you feel, just whether you are a threat or not. Little does he know….\n\n\"And now you are back.\"\n\n\"Not by choice, trust me on that.\" You let yourself sag a little, the frustration leaking to the front. This is not fake, and you hope that he picks up on that. \"Ortega pulled me into this. If I had known, I…\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have come.\"\n\nHe finishes your sentence for you, and you answer with a nod. \"I'm retired.\"\n\n\"You were never comfortable here even before you returned.\" Steel looks around the corridor, the wide, stark hallway a marked difference from their older, grimier headquarters. This place is too new to have a personality yet.\n\n",

Maybe you can actually make some use of his suspicious nature and get him to make Ortega back off. \"But let's be real here, we both know I am not the problem here.\"\n\n\"What problem?\" The new voice is enough to make both you and Steel jump.\n\n\"Herald.\" Steel gives you a thoughtful look, though he keeps talking to Herald.

Luckily, one has been missing for the past few months, and the papers have run with the story. \n\nGoing under the hero name 'Locus,' she is a young, alpha-level telepath, which is a lot rarer than you'd imagine.
